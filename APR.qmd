# Why Should I Care?

Change is inevitable and one of the hot topics in change is the discussion, advancement, and push to legalize different drugs. However, we need to remind ourselves before we get too carried away, drug consumption usage is very much still an on-going global problem. Such risk behavior cannot be isolated alone but constitute from a multitude of factors. These factors are defined as anything that increases the chances or probability of one's drug consumption(s). Primary this can be predicted and measured through an individual's attribute, characteristics, and/or life events

## Summary

### Topic:

Assessing one's risk of drug consumption use and misuse according to their personality trait(s).

### Data Collection:

The study initially received 2051 responses, but only included 1885 respondents. 12 attributes and 18 central nervous system (CNS) psychoactive drugs were included in the study. The 12 attributes can be categorized based on demographic and personality measurements. The 18 CNS psychoactive drugs includes both illicit and licit drugs. Additionally, there was a fake drug (Semeron) included to help identify any over-claimers in the study. Finally, respondents were asked to rate their drug use per drug across seven different categories. Based on their response of drug use, respondents were classified either as users or non-users.

### Data Cleaning:

In order to measure and account for the accuracy of each drug measured across the groups, a number of different classification methods were implemented and tested. Only the most effective methods were selected to help identify between users and non-users for each drug.

: ***Quantifying Categorical Variables***

***Rule of Thumb:*** The greater the value of RIG, the stronger is the indicated correlation

-   We can consider any correlation to be considered [**weak**]{.underline} **if \| *r* \| \< 0. 4**

-   We can consider any correlation to be considered [**medium**]{.underline} **if 0. 45 \> \| *r* \| ≥ 0. 4**

-   We can consider any correlation to be considered [**strong**]{.underline} **if 0. 5 \> \| *r* \| ≥ 0. 45**

-   We can consider any correlation to be considered [**very strong**]{.underline} **if \| *r* \| ≥ 0. 5**

### Data Visualizations:

For our specific data we are using, please note that any correlations **above 0.4** are to be considered relatively *strong*; any correlations **between 0.2 and 0.4** are to be considered relatively *moderate*, and for those correlations **below 0.2** are to considered to be relatively *weak*.

# What Do You Conclude?

Based on the findings, there are strong correlations between consumption of certain group of drugs. For instance, amphetamines, cannabis, cocaine, ecstasy, legal highs, LSD, and magic mushrooms can be identified as a group of drugs with strong correlation consumption. The same can be said between the strongly correlated consumption of crack and heroin. In regards to the 12 attributes, attributes will differentiate for different drugs. For example, while age can be used as the best classifier for 14 drugs; gender can be used as the best classifiers for 10 drugs, while sensation seekers (SS) can be used as the best classifiers for 8 drugs. Lastly, the classification accuracy of the drugs are considered to be relatively high. The sensitivity and specificity are greater than 70% across nearly all drug classifications, except for alcohol, cocaine, and magic mushrooms.

# How Could You Be Wrong?

-   Classification method testing - This is highly important to critically think and laterally think about how different methods of testing may get different sensitivity and specificity results.

-   Sample size - This may not entirely reflect the general public and is bias to what is actually present in the real-world.

-   Cultural - This was a global validation study and thus does not necessarily reflect inner cultural differences and identification of specific drug consumption.

-   Bias - The word "drug(s)" carries negative connotation behind it. More often than not my mind jumps to 1) illegal, 2) substance use disorder, 3) ruins lives. Again, a lot of these are associated with more illicit drugs like cocaine, meth, heroin, etc., not so much with licit drugs such as alcohol, caffeine, cannabis, chocolate, and nicotine. However, that is not to say that others may not perceive those drugs in the same way as me. How I perceive these drugs is a bias of itself. Again, mainly due to the cultural climate I live in today.
